you find the "LCM" by returning the number to its prime factors (تحليله) and then getting rid of any duplicates between the two numbers and finally Multiply the numbers together

# example
1- LCM(7,15,21)
7 = 7
15 = 3 * 5
21 = 3 * 7
LCM = 3 * 5 * 7 = 105

2- LCM(8,12)
8 = 2 * 2 * 2
12 = 2 * 2 * 3
LCM = 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 = 24
