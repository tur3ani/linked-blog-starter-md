divide and conquer is a general [[algorithm]] meaning it is an [[algorithm]] that is not only used for one problem but rather can be applied to several different ones.

it has 2 steps to it:
 **1**.  Figure out the base case. This should be the simplest possible case.
 
 **2**.  Divide or decrease your problem until it becomes the base case.
