> **1**.  Pick a pivot.

> **2**.  Partition the array into two sub-arrays: elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot.

> **3**.  Call quicksort recursively on the two sub-arrays.
#### pivots
pivots are **used in divide-and-conquer algorithms where the input data set is chopped into pieces for separate processing**. they are elements that can be compared to the other elements in the array to know which is smaller and which is bigger.
